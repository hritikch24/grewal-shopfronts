    question: 'Do I need building regulations approval to replace a shopfront?',
    answer:
      'In most cases, yes. Replacing a shopfront is classified as a material alteration under the Building Regulations, and the new installation must comply with the current Approved Documents — particularly Part L (thermal performance), Part M (access), and Part B (fire safety). Your installer should submit a building control application or use an approved inspector. Some minor repairs — such as replacing a single pane of glass like-for-like — may not require building control approval, but a full shopfront replacement almost certainly will.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What U-value does a shopfront need to achieve under Part L?',
    answer:
      'Under the 2025 update to Approved Document L (Conservation of Fuel and Power), replacement shopfront glazing in commercial buildings must achieve a centre-pane U-value of no worse than 1.6 W/m2K for the glazed elements, and the overall window unit (including frame) should target 1.4 W/m2K or better. Thermally broken aluminium frames with argon-filled double glazing and low-emissivity coatings comfortably achieve these targets. Where the shopfront includes a solid stallriser or transom panel, those elements have separate U-value requirements.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need planning permission to change my shopfront?',
    answer:
      'It depends on the location and the extent of the changes. In many cases, replacing a shopfront like-for-like or with a similar design falls under permitted development rights and does not require a planning application. However, planning permission is required if the premises is in a conservation area, is a listed building, is subject to an Article 4 Direction removing permitted development rights, or if the proposed design significantly changes the external appearance of the building. Changes to signage may also require separate Advertisement Consent. Always check with your local planning authority before starting work.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is PAS 24 and does my shopfront need it?',
    answer:
      'PAS 24 is the British Standards Institution specification for enhanced security performance of windows and doors. It tests resistance to physical attack — including attempts to force the lock, lever the frame, and break through the glazing. Since 2019, Approved Document Q (Security) of the Building Regulations requires all new and replacement doors and windows in dwellings to meet PAS 24 or equivalent. While Approved Document Q applies specifically to dwellings, many commercial insurers and specifiers now require PAS 24 compliance for commercial shopfronts, and it is increasingly specified in landlord fit-out requirements. Using PAS 24-certified shopfront systems ensures both regulatory acceptance and insurance compliance.',

            UK Shopfront Regulations &amp; Building Standards: A 2026 Guide for Business Owners
          </h1>

          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Installing or replacing a commercial shopfront in the UK involves more regulatory requirements than most business owners expect. Building Regulations, planning permission, accessibility standards, fire safety, and security specifications all apply — and getting any of them wrong can result in enforcement action, failed inspections, insurance complications, or costly retrospective remediation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            This guide sets out the key regulations and standards that apply to shopfront installations in 2026, written in practical terms for business owners, property managers, and fit-out contractors. We cover what each regulation requires, when it applies, and how to ensure compliance from the outset.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Building Regulations Part L: Thermal Performance</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Approved Document L (Conservation of Fuel and Power) sets the thermal performance standards for all building elements, including shopfront glazing, frames, and solid panels. The 2025 update — which took effect in late 2025 and applies to all work in 2026 — tightened the requirements significantly compared to the previous edition.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            For replacement shopfronts in non-domestic buildings, the key requirements are:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Glazed elements:</strong> Centre-pane U-value of no worse than 1.6 W/m2K. In practice, argon-filled double-glazed units with a low-emissivity coating achieve around 1.1 W/m2K, comfortably exceeding the requirement.</li>
            <li><strong>Overall window unit:</strong> The combined U-value of glazing plus frame should target 1.4 W/m2K or better. Thermally broken aluminium profiles are essential to achieve this — non-thermally-broken aluminium creates a thermal bridge through the frame that degrades overall performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Solid panels (stallrisers, transoms):</strong> Insulated panels must achieve a U-value of 0.26 W/m2K or better, consistent with the general requirement for replacement non-domestic building fabric.</li>
            <li><strong>Air tightness:</strong> The shopfront must be draught-sealed to prevent uncontrolled air leakage. All junctions between the shopfront frame and the building structure must be sealed with appropriate weatherproofing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Compliance is demonstrated through the building control process. Your installer should provide U-value calculations for the proposed glazing and frame system, and building control will verify these as part of the sign-off. At Grewal Shopfront & Shutters, our standard <Link href="/services/aluminium-shopfronts" className="text-gold font-medium hover:underline">aluminium shopfront systems</Link> use thermally broken profiles and high-performance glazing that meet Part L 2025 requirements as standard.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Building Regulations Part M: Accessibility and DDA Compliance</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Approved Document M (Access to and Use of Buildings) sets out accessibility requirements for commercial premises. For shopfronts, the key provisions relate to entrance doors, thresholds, and approach routes. These requirements overlap with — and are reinforced by — the Equality Act 2010 (which replaced the Disability Discrimination Act), which requires service providers to make reasonable adjustments to ensure disabled people can access their services.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The practical requirements for a compliant shopfront entrance include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Minimum clear opening width:</strong> 800mm for new-build commercial entrances, though 1,000mm is recommended and is the norm for modern shopfronts.</li>
            <li><strong>Level or low threshold:</strong> The threshold must be level or have a maximum upstand of 15mm. Ramped approaches must have a gradient no steeper than 1:12 with handrails where the rise exceeds 300mm.</li>
            <li><strong>Door operation:</strong> Doors must be operable with one hand without requiring tight gripping or twisting. <Link href="/services/automatic-doors" className="text-gold font-medium hover:underline">Automatic sliding or swing doors</Link> provide the highest level of accessibility and are increasingly expected in commercial premises.</li>
            <li><strong>Manifestation:</strong> Glass doors and full-height glazed panels must have contrasting manifestation (typically horizontal bands or dots) at two heights — 850mm to 1,000mm and 1,400mm to 1,600mm from floor level — to make them visible to people with visual impairments.</li>
            <li><strong>Colour contrast:</strong> Door frames, handles, and push plates should contrast visually with the surrounding surfaces to assist people with low vision.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Non-compliance with Part M can result in building control refusing to sign off the installation. Non-compliance with the Equality Act can result in legal action from individuals who are unable to access the premises. Both are avoidable with proper design from the outset.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Building Regulations Part B: Fire Safety</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Approved Document B (Fire Safety) applies to shopfronts where the shopfront forms part of a fire compartment boundary or where the premises is above or adjacent to a different occupancy. The requirements are complex and depend on the specific building configuration, but the most common implications for shopfronts are:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Fire-rated glazing:</strong> Where the shopfront is within a specified distance of the site boundary or an adjacent building, the glazing may need to achieve a fire resistance rating (typically 30 or 60 minutes integrity). Fire-rated glass — such as Pyroguard or Pilkington Pyrostop — provides this without looking significantly different from standard glazing.</li>
            <li><strong>Fire doors:</strong> Entrance doors that form part of a fire compartment must be <Link href="/services/fire-doors" className="text-gold font-medium hover:underline">fire-rated doors</Link> — typically FD30 (30 minutes) or FD60 (60 minutes). Fire doors must be self-closing and fitted with intumescent strips and cold smoke seals.</li>
            <li><strong>Escape routes:</strong> Shopfront doors that serve as final exits on escape routes must open outward, must not be locked against egress, and must be operable without a key from the inside. Panic hardware (push bars) is required on final exit doors where the premises has an occupancy above a certain threshold.</li>
            <li><strong>Cavity barriers:</strong> Where the shopfront system creates a cavity (for example, above a suspended ceiling or within a fascia panel), fire cavity barriers must be installed to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through concealed spaces.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Fire safety requirements are assessed on a building-by-building basis, and a fire risk assessment should inform the specification.

          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Planning Permission Requirements</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Planning permission and building regulations are separate regimes. You may need one, the other, or both. Planning permission concerns the external appearance and use of the building; building regulations concern the technical performance of the construction.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            For shopfront replacement, planning permission is typically required in the following circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>The premises is in a <strong>conservation area</strong></li>
            <li>The building is <strong>listed</strong> (Grade I, II*, or II) — in which case Listed Building Consent is also needed</li>
            <li>An <strong>Article 4 Direction</strong> is in place removing permitted development rights for shopfront alterations</li>
            <li>The proposed design <strong>materially changes the external appearance</strong> of the building (for example, enlarging the opening, adding a canopy, or changing the shopfront from timber to aluminium)</li>
            <li>New or altered <strong>signage</strong> — which requires separate Advertisement Consent under the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) Regulations 2007</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For a detailed walkthrough of the planning process, read our guide on <Link href="/blog/aluminium-shopfront-planning-permission-uk" className="text-gold font-medium hover:underline">aluminium shopfront planning permission</Link>.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Conservation Areas and Listed Buildings</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Conservation areas have additional controls over shopfront design. Permitted development rights are restricted, and any external alteration that affects the character or appearance of the building requires planning permission. Local planning authorities publish conservation area appraisals and, in many cases, shopfront design guides that set out acceptable materials, proportions, colours, and detailing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            For listed buildings, any alteration that affects the character of the building as a building of special architectural or historic interest requires Listed Building Consent — a separate application from planning permission. This includes internal as well as external alterations. Installing a new shopfront in a listed building without consent is a criminal offence.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Modern thermally broken aluminium systems can be designed to be sympathetic to historic buildings — using slim profiles, heritage colours, and traditional proportions — while still achieving current Building Regulations performance standards. Early engagement with the local authority conservation officer is strongly recommended.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">PAS 24: Enhanced Security Performance</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            PAS 24 (Enhanced Security Performance Requirements for Doorsets and Windows) is the British Standards Institution&rsquo;s specification for security testing. It assesses resistance to physical attack — including manipulation of the locking mechanism, levering of the frame, and impact on the glazing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Under Approved Document Q (Security in Dwellings), PAS 24 is a mandatory requirement for all new and replacement doors and windows in residential properties. For commercial shopfronts, Document Q does not formally apply, but PAS 24 is increasingly specified by landlords, insurers, and fit-out consultants as a baseline security standard. Many commercial aluminium shopfront systems are tested and certified to PAS 24, and specifying a PAS 24-compliant system adds minimal cost while providing demonstrable security credentials.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For higher security requirements — particularly in high-crime areas or for premises with valuable stock — <Link href="/blog/what-is-lps-1175-security-rating" className="text-gold font-medium hover:underline">LPS 1175-rated products</Link> provide a higher level of tested resistance.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">BS EN 16005: Automatic Door Safety</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            BS EN 16005 is the European standard for the safety in use of power-operated pedestrian doorsets. It applies to all <Link href="/services/automatic-doors" className="text-gold font-medium hover:underline">automatic doors</Link> installed in commercial premises — including sliding, swing, and revolving types. The standard specifies requirements for sensor detection zones, closing forces, speed limitations, safety markings, and emergency breakout capability.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Key requirements include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Presence and motion detection sensors covering the full sweep area of the door</li>
            <li>Maximum closing force limits to prevent injury — typically 150N for sliding doors and 67N at the leading edge for swing doors</li>
            <li>Emergency breakout capability allowing the door to be pushed open manually in the event of power failure or emergency evacuation</li>
            <li>Safety signage and manifestation on the glazed panels</li>
            <li>A documented risk assessment specific to the installation location</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Automatic doors must be installed by competent persons and commissioned with a full BS EN 16005 risk assessment and compliance certificate. Ongoing maintenance — including six-monthly safety checks — is recommended by the standard and is a practical requirement of most commercial insurance policies.

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Getting It Right from the Start</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The regulatory landscape for UK shopfronts is complex, but it is manageable when you work with an installer who understands it. The most expensive mistakes are retrospective ones — installing a shopfront that fails building control inspection, triggers enforcement action from the planning authority, or is rejected by the building insurer.
