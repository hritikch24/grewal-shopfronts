    question: 'What LPS 1175 security rating do I need for my shop?',
    answer:
      'For most high-street retail premises, SR2 (Security Rating 2) provides an appropriate level of protection against opportunistic attack using common hand tools. Higher-risk premises — such as jewellers, electronics retailers, pharmacies, and off-licences — should consider SR3, which resists more sustained attacks with heavier tools. SR4 is typically specified for banks, post offices, and premises storing high-value goods or controlled substances. Your insurer may specify a minimum rating as a condition of cover, so check your policy wording before ordering.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much do commercial security shutters cost in 2026?',
    answer:
      'Prices vary considerably depending on the type, size, security rating, and operation method. As a guide for 2026: a basic manually operated aluminium lath roller shutter costs from £800 to £1,500 per opening. An electrically operated aluminium shutter with remote control costs from £1,500 to £3,000. A solid steel security shutter with LPS 1175 SR2 certification starts from around £2,500 to £4,500, and SR3-rated shutters typically cost £4,000 to £7,000 or more. Fire-rated shutters carry an additional premium of 30% to 50% over standard equivalents.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do security shutters reduce my insurance premiums?',
    answer:
      'In many cases, yes. Commercial insurers recognise certificated security shutters as a physical risk reduction measure. Installing LPS 1175-rated shutters can reduce premiums by 5% to 15%, depending on the insurer, the rating level, and the overall risk profile of the premises. Some insurers make security shutters a condition of cover for premises in high-crime areas or for businesses holding high-value stock. Always inform your insurer when you install new security measures, and provide copies of the certification documentation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between perforated and solid roller shutters?',
    answer:
      'Solid roller shutters — made from steel or aluminium laths with no openings — provide maximum security and complete visual screening. They are appropriate for premises where after-hours visibility is not needed or desired. Perforated roller shutters have punched holes or a mesh pattern in the laths, typically providing 25% to 40% open area. This allows passers-by to see the window display, deters graffiti (as the shutter surface is irregular), and lets natural light into the premises. Perforated shutters are popular with retailers who want security without completely hiding their shopfront, though they offer slightly less physical resistance than solid equivalents.',

            The Complete Guide to Commercial Security Shutters in the UK (2026)
          </h1>

          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Security shutters are one of the most effective physical security measures available to UK businesses. They protect glazing, deter break-ins, reduce insurance costs, and — when specified correctly — provide certified resistance against forced entry that satisfies both insurers and the police. But the range of products on the market is wide, and choosing the wrong shutter can leave your premises under-protected or your insurance invalid.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            This guide covers everything a UK business owner needs to know about commercial security shutters in 2026: the types available, how security ratings work, what insurers expect, electric versus manual operation, fire-rated options, and realistic cost expectations. Whether you run a high-street shop, a pharmacy, a restaurant, or a warehouse, this is a practical reference for making the right decision.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Types of Commercial Security Shutters</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Commercial shutters fall into four main categories, each suited to different security requirements, budgets, and aesthetic preferences.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-heading text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Solid Steel Roller Shutters</h3>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Solid steel shutters are constructed from interlocking galvanised steel laths, typically 75mm to 100mm deep, rolled into a compact headbox above the opening. They provide the highest level of physical security and are the standard choice for premises requiring LPS 1175 certification. When closed, they completely conceal and protect the glazing behind them. Solid steel shutters are specified for jewellers, pharmacies, off-licences, electronics retailers, post offices, and any premises where the contents are high-value or high-risk.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The main drawback is weight — steel shutters require robust structural fixings and, in most commercial applications, electric operation. They also completely obscure the shopfront when closed, which can make a street feel less welcoming after hours.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-heading text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Perforated Roller Shutters</h3>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Perforated shutters use steel or aluminium laths with punched holes or a brick-bond pattern, allowing visibility through the shutter when closed. This lets passers-by see window displays and internal lighting, which has a positive effect on the streetscape and can deter antisocial behaviour. Perforated shutters are widely used by high-street retailers, especially those in town-centre locations where local authorities discourage solid shutters on amenity grounds.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Security performance is lower than solid steel — the perforations reduce the structural integrity of each lath — but perforated shutters still provide substantial deterrence and delay against opportunistic attack. Some manufacturers offer LPS 1175 SR1-rated perforated options.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-heading text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Polycarbonate Roller Shutters</h3>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Polycarbonate shutters use transparent or tinted polycarbonate laths held in aluminium carriers. They provide full visibility of the shopfront and window displays when closed, combined with a reasonable level of impact resistance. Polycarbonate is significantly lighter than steel, which reduces the structural load on the shopfront and allows larger spans without additional reinforcement.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            These shutters are popular with fashion retailers, phone shops, and restaurants in premium locations where visual merchandising continues after hours. They are not suitable for high-security applications — polycarbonate can be cut with power tools relatively quickly — but they provide effective deterrence against smash-and-grab attacks and are highly resistant to impact from thrown objects.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-heading text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Aluminium Lath Shutters</h3>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Aluminium lath shutters sit between steel and polycarbonate in terms of both security and cost. They are lighter than steel, more affordable, and available in a wide range of powder-coated finishes that complement the shopfront aesthetics. Aluminium shutters are the most common choice for general retail, takeaways, salons, and service businesses where a moderate level of security is sufficient. They can be specified with insulated laths for premises where thermal performance matters — particularly useful for food-service businesses with large openings. Our <Link href="/services/roller-shutters" className="text-gold font-medium hover:underline">roller shutter installation service</Link> covers all four types.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">LPS 1175 Security Ratings Explained</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            LPS 1175 is the Loss Prevention Standard published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE). It is the UK&rsquo;s most widely recognised standard for physical security products, and it is the benchmark that insurers, police, and specifiers use to assess the resistance of shutters, doors, and windows to forced entry.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The standard defines Security Ratings (SR) based on the tools and time an attacker would need to breach the product:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-3">
            <li><strong>SR1:</strong> Resists attack from bodily force and opportunistic use of found objects (stones, sticks). Provides basic deterrence against impulsive, unskilled attack. Suitable for low-risk premises.</li>
            <li><strong>SR2:</strong> Resists attack using common hand tools — screwdrivers, pliers, small crowbars. This is the most commonly specified level for standard retail premises and is accepted by most commercial insurers as adequate physical security.</li>
            <li><strong>SR3:</strong> Resists sustained attack using more powerful hand tools and mechanical tools — larger crowbars, battery-powered drills, and saws. Specified for higher-risk premises including jewellers, pharmacies, and electronics retailers.</li>
            <li><strong>SR4:</strong> Resists attack using mains-powered tools — angle grinders, reciprocating saws, and hydraulic tools. Specified for banks, post offices, gun shops, and premises storing controlled substances or extremely high-value stock.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For a more detailed explanation, see our guide on <Link href="/blog/what-is-lps-1175-security-rating" className="text-gold font-medium hover:underline">what the LPS 1175 security rating means</Link>. When selecting a shutter, always check that the specific product — not just the manufacturer — holds current LPS 1175 certification. The certificate should name the exact product model and the SR level achieved. Products listed on the LPCB RedBook (redbooklive.com) have verified, current certification.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Insurance Implications and Requirements</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Commercial property insurance policies increasingly specify physical security requirements as conditions of cover. If your policy states that the premises must have security shutters to a particular standard and you have not installed them — or you have installed the wrong standard — a claim may be refused.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The most common insurance stipulations in 2026 are:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Security shutters to LPS 1175 SR2 minimum on all accessible openings</li>
            <li><Link href="/services/security-doors" className="text-gold font-medium hover:underline">Security doors</Link> to PAS 24 or LPS 1175 on rear and side entrances</li>
            <li>Electric operation with key-switch or remote control (to prevent staff from leaving shutters open)</li>
            <li>Annual maintenance records demonstrating the shutters are in working order</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Electric vs Manual Operation</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Manual roller shutters are operated by a hand crank, push-up mechanism, or chain hoist. They have no electrical components, which means lower upfront cost, no motor maintenance, and continued operation during power cuts. However, manual shutters are only practical for smaller openings — typically up to three metres wide — and require physical effort to operate. For security-critical applications, there is a risk that staff will leave a manual shutter partially raised for convenience.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Electric roller shutters use a tubular motor housed inside the barrel, controlled by a key-switch, remote control, or building management system. They are essential for larger openings and heavier shutter types (particularly solid steel), and they eliminate the possibility of the shutter being left partially open. Most commercial insurers prefer or require electric operation. Electric shutters can also be connected to fire alarm systems for automatic deployment, intruder alarms for automatic closing, and timer systems for scheduled operation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Fire-Rated Shutters and Regulations</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Fire-rated roller shutters are required where a shutter forms part of a fire compartment boundary — for example, between a shop unit and a shared service corridor, loading bay, or adjacent premises. Building Regulations Approved Document B sets out the fire resistance requirements, and the specific rating needed depends on the building use, the location of the shutter within the building, and the fire strategy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Fire-rated shutters are tested to BS EN 1634-1 and classified as E (integrity) or EI (integrity and insulation) with a time rating — typically 60, 120, or 240 minutes. A fire shutter rated EI 60 maintains both integrity and insulation for 60 minutes. Fire shutters must be installed by competent contractors and commissioned with a certificate of conformity. They must be connected to the building&rsquo;s fire detection system so that they close automatically when smoke or heat is detected, and they must have a manual release mechanism. Annual testing and maintenance by a competent person is a legal requirement under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Cost Expectations in 2026</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Security shutter costs depend on the type, material, size, security rating, and whether the installation requires structural modifications. The following ranges are indicative for a standard single-opening installation in 2026, including supply and fitting:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Manual aluminium lath shutter:</strong> £800 – £1,500</li>
            <li><strong>Electric aluminium lath shutter:</strong> £1,500 – £3,000</li>
            <li><strong>Perforated steel shutter (electric):</strong> £2,000 – £3,500</li>
            <li><strong>Polycarbonate roller shutter (electric):</strong> £2,500 – £4,000</li>
            <li><strong>Solid steel, LPS 1175 SR2 (electric):</strong> £2,500 – £4,500</li>
            <li><strong>Solid steel, LPS 1175 SR3 (electric):</strong> £4,000 – £7,000</li>
            <li><strong>Fire-rated shutter EI 60 (electric):</strong> £4,000 – £8,000</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Multiple openings on the same premises are typically quoted at a reduced per-unit rate. For a detailed breakdown, visit our <Link href="/cost-guide" className="text-gold font-medium hover:underline">shopfront cost guide</Link>.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Choosing the Right Shutter for Your Business</h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The right security shutter depends on three factors: your security risk, your insurer&rsquo;s requirements, and the aesthetic context of your premises. Start by reviewing your insurance policy wording to identify any specified security standards. Then assess the crime risk for your location — your local police crime prevention officer can advise, and police.uk provides area-level crime data. Finally, consider the visual impact: solid steel shutters may be the most secure option, but if your premises is in a town-centre location or conservation area, perforated or polycarbonate alternatives may be more appropriate — and more likely to gain planning consent.
