    description: `Aluminium has become the material of choice for commercial shopfront construction across the UK, and for good reason. When specified and installed correctly, an aluminium shopfront system offers an outstanding combination of structural rigidity, weather resistance, design flexibility, and long service life that no other material can match at a comparable price point.

At Grewal Shopfront & Shutters, we design and install aluminium shopfronts to suit everything from a single independent retailer to a multi-unit retail parade or commercial development. Our systems are sourced from leading European fabricators and conform to the relevant British Standards, including BS 6375 for the performance of windows and doors, and BS EN 14351-1, which governs the CE marking requirements for aluminium entrance doors.

**Frame Systems and Thermal Performance**

We work with both standard commercial-grade aluminium profiles and thermally broken systems. For most modern retail units and any installation subject to Building Regulations Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Power), thermally broken frames are required. These incorporate a polyamide thermal break within the aluminium section that dramatically reduces heat loss through the frame, helping occupiers meet energy performance obligations and reduce heating costs.

Centre-pane U-values for our double-glazed units typically fall between 1.0 and 1.4 W/m²K depending on the glass specification chosen, and our complete window and door assemblies are independently tested to demonstrate compliance with the current Building Regulations threshold.

**Glazing Specifications**

All glazing installed within our shopfront systems uses toughened safety glass as a minimum, in line with BS EN 12150-1. Where a unit faces a high-traffic pedestrian zone, or where the glazed area falls within the critical zone defined by BS 8213-4 (below 800 mm from floor level), we specify toughened or laminated glass rated to the appropriate safety category.

For retailers with specific requirements — reduced solar gain, acoustic attenuation, enhanced security — we can specify solar-control glass, acoustic interlayers, or laminated security glass to PAS 24:2022, the standard used to assess enhanced security performance for doors and windows. Many landlords and insurers now require PAS 24 certification for new commercial glazing.

**Entrance Design and DDA Compliance**

The Equality Act 2010 (which replaced the Disability Discrimination Act) requires that commercial premises make reasonable adjustments to avoid putting disabled people at a substantial disadvantage. For shopfronts, this most commonly relates to entrance door widths, threshold heights, and door opening forces.

We design our entrance systems with a minimum 775 mm clear opening width as standard, and can extend this to 900 mm or beyond for full accessibility. Threshold details are coordinated with the structural floor level to eliminate trip hazards, and where lever or D-pull hardware is specified, we select furniture that meets the ergonomic requirements referenced in BS 8300, the standard for the design of an accessible and inclusive built environment.

**Powder Coat Finishes**

All aluminium sections are powder-coated to BS EN 12206-1, which specifies performance requirements for organic coatings on aluminium alloy extrusions. We offer the full RAL palette as standard, and can access BS 4800 and NCS colour references on request. Our standard powder-coat guarantee is 10 years for colour retention and adhesion under normal UK weather exposure conditions.

For listed buildings or conservation areas, we have worked alongside planning consultants to specify sympathetic colour matches and slimline profiles that satisfy planning officer requirements without compromising performance.

**Installation Process**

Every installation begins with a measured survey of the existing opening or structural aperture. We co-ordinate with the structural engineer's lintel design where a new opening is being formed, and we take the relevant Party Wall Act notifications into account for terraced or semi-detached commercial properties. Our installation teams are CSCS-carded and follow a site-specific method statement and risk assessment for every project.`,

    description: `Roller shutters are one of the most practical and cost-effective security solutions available to commercial and industrial property owners. When correctly specified for the application, a roller shutter provides reliable overnight security, weather protection, and where required, fire containment — all within a compact, retractable assembly that does not impede the operation of the premises during trading hours.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters designs, supplies, and installs roller shutters across a wide range of commercial applications, from small retail units requiring a face-fit manual curtain to large industrial loading bays needing a high-speed, motor-driven door with full automation and safety edge protection.

**Curtain Construction and Security Ratings**

Roller shutter curtains are available in perforated, solid, and vision-strip configurations. Perforated laths allow some visibility and airflow when the shutter is closed and can reduce the visual impact of a shuttered frontage. Solid lath curtains provide maximum weather exclusion and privacy.

For security-critical applications, we specify curtains tested to LPS 1175 (Loss Prevention Standard 1175), the industry benchmark for physical attack resistance. LPS 1175 is graded from A (basic deterrence) through to H (resistance to prolonged attack with specialist tools), and the appropriate grade is selected in consultation with the client's insurer and in accordance with the risk profile of the premises. Many commercial insurers now require a minimum of LPS 1175 SR1 or SR2 for unattended retail premises.

Curtain laths are roll-formed from galvanised mild steel or aluminium alloy. Aluminium is specified where weight, corrosion resistance, or annual maintenance burden is a primary concern; steel is typically preferred where higher security ratings or impact resistance is paramount.

**Operating Systems**

Manual shutters are operated via a spring-balanced mechanism — the spring stores energy as the shutter closes and releases it to assist opening. Manual operation is appropriate for smaller openings up to approximately 3.5 m in width and where operating frequency is modest.

Electric shutters use a tubular or side-mounted motor connected to a gear reducer and drive shaft. They are operated by a key switch, push-button panel, or remote control, and can be integrated with a building management system or external timer for automated opening and closing. All our electric shutter installations include a manual override mechanism to allow operation during a power failure.

Safety edges, photocells, and pressure-sensitive bottom rails are fitted as standard on all motorised installations, in line with the Machinery Directive (now retained in UK law as the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008) and the guidance issued by the Door and Hardware Federation (DHF).

**Fire-Rated Roller Shutters**

Fire-rated roller shutters provide compartmentalisation in commercial and industrial premises, containing the spread of fire between zones in accordance with the passive fire protection strategy for the building. Our fire shutters are designed and tested in accordance with BS EN 1634-1 (fire resistance and smoke control tests for door and shutter assemblies) and carry the appropriate fire performance classification — typically EI 60 or EI 90, denoting integrity and insulation for 60 or 90 minutes respectively.

Fire shutters are controlled by a fusible link or, in more sophisticated installations, by a signal from the building's fire detection and alarm system. Gravity-fail-safe release is standard, ensuring the shutter closes automatically on detection of a fire even if power is lost.

Installation of fire shutters must be completed and certified by a company with appropriate third-party accreditation. Grewal Shopfront & Shutters holds the relevant certification and provides a fire shutter completion certificate that forms part of the building's fire safety record.

**Structural Considerations**

Roller shutters impose both dead loads (the weight of the curtain and housing box) and dynamic loads (wind, impact, and operation forces) on the surrounding structure. Before installation, we assess the condition and load-bearing capacity of the lintel or structural member above the opening. Where the existing structure is inadequate, we work with a structural engineer to design a suitable bearing arrangement.

All shutters are installed with a weather seal along both side guides and at the bottom rail, preventing draught and water ingress when closed. For installations in exposed coastal locations, we specify enhanced corrosion protection, including marine-grade aluminium sections and stainless-steel fixings.`,

    description: `A commercial security door is one of the most important investments a business can make in protecting its assets, staff, and premises. Unlike a standard commercial entrance door, a properly specified security door is engineered from the ground up to resist physical attack, and its performance is independently verified through structured testing rather than manufacturer claims.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters supplies and installs commercial security doors across a broad range of applications — back-of-house access points, warehouse and depot entrances, plant rooms, server rooms, cash-handling areas, and anywhere else where the consequence of an unauthorised breach is severe.

**Standards and Security Ratings**

Two principal standards govern the tested performance of commercial security doors in the UK. LPS 1175 (Loss Prevention Standard 1175), published by the LPCB (Loss Prevention Certification Board), tests door sets against attack using progressively more capable tools over defined time periods, producing a rating from SR1 (basic resistance, hand tools only) through to SR8 (resistance to sustained attack with heavy plant). The LPCB maintains a publically searchable Red Book of certified products, allowing insurers and specifiers to verify the rating of any door set they are considering.

STS 202 (Security Tested Standard 202), published by the LPCB's sister organisation, follows a similar attack-testing methodology and is sometimes preferred by specific insurers or procurement frameworks. Many commercial insurers specify a minimum LPS 1175 SR2 or STS 202 BR2 rating for back-of-house entrances in high-value retail or commercial premises.

**Construction: Steel vs Composite**

Steel security door leaves are fabricated from cold-rolled steel sheet, typically 1.5–3 mm in thickness, reinforced with internal steel box sections. The outer face may be smooth, embossed, or finished with a polyester powder coat. Steel doors are exceptionally strong and can be manufactured to accept very high-security locking systems, but they are heavy (a 1.0 × 2.1 m single-leaf door can exceed 80 kg), which imposes demands on the frame and hinges.

Composite security doors use a laminated construction — steel skins bonded to a rigid foam or honeycomb core. This approach provides excellent stiffness-to-weight ratio, improved thermal insulation compared to solid steel, and resistance to the peel and lever attacks that exploit the bond line between face sheet and frame on lower-quality doors. Our composite range includes door sets tested to LPS 1175 SR2 and SR3.

**Door Frames and Installation**

A security door is only as strong as its frame and its fixing into the surrounding structure. We install all security doors with purpose-designed steel sub-frames or knock-box frames that are fixed through to the structural wall using torque-controlled anchor bolts at centres determined by the load calculations for the specified security rating. Where the structural wall is constructed from materials with lower pull-out resistance (dense concrete blocks, for example), we use resin anchors to achieve the required fixing capacity.

Frame depth is matched to the wall thickness, and all perimeter joints are filled with fire-rated intumescent material where the door set forms part of a fire-compartment boundary.

**Locking Systems**

Our standard commercial security doors are supplied with a multi-point locking mechanism engaging the frame at a minimum of five points — top, bottom, and three along the strike side. The lock body is a high-security euro profile cylinder resisting to TS 007 3-star or equivalent, offering anti-drill, anti-pick, and anti-bump protection. Master-keying and key-alike suites are available for multi-door installations.

Where a door is used as a means of escape, we specify panic hardware conforming to BS EN 1125 (panic exit devices) or emergency exit devices conforming to BS EN 179. The distinction is important: BS EN 1125 covers single-action operation regardless of the user's ability or awareness, whereas BS EN 179 permits a lever or knob that requires a specific action. The fire strategy and means of escape design for the building determines which standard applies.

**Access Control Integration**

Security doors can be supplied with integrated access control provisions — electric strikes, magnetic locks, door controllers, and card or PIN reader mounting plates. We work alongside access control specialists and, where required, coordinate the door hardware specification with the access control installer to ensure compatibility between the mechanical and electronic elements of the system.`,

      'Automatic sliding and swing door installation for retail and commercial premises. BS EN 16005 compliant. DDA-friendly entrances. Nationwide UK coverage.',
    description: `Automatic doors are no longer a luxury reserved for supermarkets and airports. For any commercial premises with significant footfall — a busy high-street retail unit, a medical centre, a hotel lobby, or a multi-occupancy office building — automatic door systems offer a compelling combination of accessibility compliance, operational efficiency, and customer experience that increasingly represents the expected standard rather than a premium option.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters designs, installs, and maintains automatic door systems for commercial clients across the UK. We work with sliding, swing, and folding automatic configurations, using drive units from established European manufacturers who certify their products to the relevant harmonised standards.

**Automatic Sliding Doors**

Sliding automatic door systems are the most common configuration for retail entrances and busy public-facing premises. They operate by translating the door leaf along a track above the aperture, driven by a low-voltage DC or brushless motor controlled by a drive unit that continuously monitors the safety sensor field. A bi-parting arrangement — two leaves meeting in the centre — provides the largest possible clear opening width from a given aperture, making it the preferred solution for wheelchair access and high-volume pedestrian flow.

Our sliding door systems are installed with activation sensors covering the approach zone and safety sensors covering the opening zone in accordance with BS EN 16005:2012, the harmonised European standard for power-operated pedestrian doorsets — safety in use. This standard defines minimum sensor fields, maximum closing forces (no greater than 150 N dynamic and 25 N static), maximum closing speeds (0.5 m/s standard, 0.3 m/s for low-energy applications), and the minimum break-out force for emergency egress. Compliance with BS EN 16005 is required for all power-operated doors in public buildings and is referenced in Approved Document M of the Building Regulations.

**Automatic Swing Doors**

Swing automatic doors are preferred where an existing shopfront frame is retained and a sliding track overhead would be architecturally intrusive, or where the entrance is narrow and a bi-parting sliding arrangement is not feasible. The drive unit is concealed within the door frame or overhead closer case, and the door can be programmed to hold-open, swing-and-return, or operate in push-and-go mode where a gentle push from the user completes the automatic opening sequence.

Low-energy swing door operators — sometimes marketed as "push and go" systems — fall under a specific sub-clause of BS EN 16005 governing low-energy automated doors. They are particularly appropriate for healthcare premises, care homes, and residential buildings where a high-speed automatic entry would be hazardous or inappropriate.

**DDA and Accessibility Compliance**

Automatic doors make a direct contribution to compliance with the Equality Act 2010. The Act's reasonable adjustment duty requires that physical features which disadvantage disabled people are removed or altered. A power-operated entrance door eliminates the physical effort of pulling a heavy door, removes the need to hold a door open for a wheelchair user, and removes the cognitive and physical challenge of managing a door and a wheelchair simultaneously.

BS 8300:2018, the British Standard for the design of an accessible and inclusive built environment, recommends automatic doors at principal entrances to public buildings and specifies minimum clear opening widths of 800 mm for single doors and 1500 mm for bi-parting sliding sets. We design all our installations to exceed these minimum dimensions where the structural opening permits.

**Safety Systems and Certification**

Every Grewal Shopfront & Shutters automatic door installation is completed with a full safety test record documenting sensor fields, closing forces, closing speeds, and emergency egress performance. The completed door is labelled with the installation date, drive unit serial number, and the name of the responsible installer, in accordance with the Automatic Door Suppliers Association (ADSA) Code of Practice.

Following installation, we provide a handover document including the user manual, sensor field diagrams, emergency override procedures, and our recommended maintenance schedule. Annual safety inspection and maintenance by a competent person — as defined in BS EN 16005 — is a requirement for continued compliance, and we offer maintenance agreements structured around this obligation.

**Integration with Access Control and Fire Alarm Systems**

Automatic doors can be integrated with access control readers for out-of-hours security, with intercom systems for controlled access, and with the building's fire alarm panel. On receipt of a fire signal, the door can be configured to either open and hold (to facilitate evacuation) or to close and hold on the latch (where the door forms part of a smoke control lobby). The correct fail-safe position is determined by the fire strategy for the building, and we liaise with the fire engineer or building control body where this is not already specified.`,

    description: `Commercial bi-fold door systems — sometimes called bifold or folding-sliding doors — are increasingly specified for retail, hospitality, and leisure premises where the ability to open up an entire frontage or elevation creates a fundamentally different trading proposition. A café that can open its complete street-facing wall on a warm day, or a showroom that can create a seamless transition between indoor display and an external forecourt, gains a competitive advantage that a conventional hinged or sliding arrangement simply cannot replicate.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters designs and installs commercial aluminium bi-fold systems to suit openings from 2 m to over 12 m in width. Our systems are sourced from fabricators whose products are independently tested and certified to the performance standards that commercial applications demand.

**How Commercial Bi-Fold Systems Work**

A bi-fold door system consists of a series of individual door panels — typically between two and eight per run — connected by hinges and suspended from a top-hung track or supported by a bottom-running track. When opening, the panels fold against each other accordion-fashion and stack compactly to one or both sides of the opening, creating the maximum possible clear aperture.

Top-hung systems are preferred for commercial use: because the track carries the panel weight, the floor threshold can be a low-profile weather seal rather than a structural bottom track, minimising the trip hazard and improving DDA compliance. Bottom-running systems are used where the header structure cannot carry the suspended load, but they require a more substantial threshold detail.

The stacking configuration — whether panels fold to the left, to the right, or split to both sides — is determined by the operational requirements and the available stacking space. Traffic-door options (a separate hinged panel within the bi-fold run that operates independently) allow pedestrian access without opening the full system.

**Weather Performance and Testing**

Commercial bi-fold doors are exposed to the full range of UK weather conditions, including driving rain, wind loads, and thermal cycling. The relevant performance standard is BS 6375, which covers air permeability, watertightness, and wind resistance for opening building elements. For commercial premises facing exposed street elevations, we specify systems tested to the mid-range or upper categories of BS 6375 — typically Class 3 or 4 for watertightness and Category B or C for wind resistance — rather than the lower-category systems marketed primarily at the residential sector.

Thermal performance is addressed through thermally broken frame profiles. Unlike most residential bi-fold systems, which use a standard aluminium section, our commercial-grade systems incorporate a continuous polyamide thermal break throughout the frame and sill, delivering a complete door assembly U-value compliant with Building Regulations Part L for non-domestic buildings.

**Structural Requirements**

Opening up a large section of an existing building elevation for a bi-fold installation almost always involves structural work. The removal of masonry or the widening of an existing opening requires a structural engineer's design for the replacement lintel or beam — typically a steel universal beam or a reinforced concrete boot lintel — sized to carry the loads above, including wind uplift and the weight of the new door system.

We coordinate this structural work as part of our project management service, and where Building Regulations approval is required for the structural alteration, we manage the application through an Approved Inspector or local authority building control.

**Glazing and Security**

Bi-fold door panels are typically glazed with double-glazed units incorporating toughened outer and inner panes. For enhanced security, laminated inner panes to BS EN ISO 12543 (laminated glass) can be specified; these resist the smash-and-grab attack that a toughened monolithic pane is vulnerable to after initial fracture.

Locking is provided at multiple points along each panel. The outermost panel — the one that closes against the threshold and jamb when the system is shut — carries the primary locking hardware, typically a multi-point espagnolette or shoot-bolt system engaging the frame at the head, sill, and strike side. The folded stack of inner panels is secured against the outer panel by secondary locks.

For overnight security in high-footfall or high-risk locations, bi-fold systems can be combined with a roller shutter in the same structural opening, with the shutter housing concealed within the header detail above the bi-fold frame.`,

          'Commercial top-hung bi-fold systems can accommodate anywhere from two to ten or more panels in a single run, depending on the track capacity and the available stacking space. Beyond eight panels in a single stack, it is usually preferable to use a split configuration — panels stacking to both ends — to keep stack depth manageable and reduce the operating force.

      'Supply and installation of certified commercial fire doors. FD30, FD60, FD90 rated. Intumescent seals, tested hardware, third-party certification. UK-wide.',
    description: `Fire doors are the most safety-critical doors installed in any commercial building, and their correct specification, installation, and ongoing maintenance are non-negotiable legal requirements for any responsible building owner or manager. The consequences of a fire door failing to perform as designed — either because it was incorrectly specified, poorly installed, or not maintained — are severe: lives can be lost, and the building owner or responsible person faces criminal liability under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 and the Fire Safety Act 2021.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters takes this responsibility seriously. We supply and install fire door assemblies that are third-party certified, install them strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions, and document every installation with a completion record that can be presented to the responsible person, the building control body, or a fire inspector.

**Understanding Fire Door Ratings**

Fire doors are classified by the duration for which the closed assembly resists the passage of fire and, where specified, smoke. In the UK, the common designations are:

- **FD30** — provides 30 minutes' integrity (E) protection. The most common classification for corridor and compartment doors in commercial buildings.
- **FD60** — provides 60 minutes' integrity, required for high-risk areas such as plant rooms containing significant fuel load, basement-to-ground-floor stair doors in tall buildings, and certain retail and storage areas.
- **FD90 and FD120** — 90- and 120-minute ratings for specialist applications including protected lobbies in hospitals, high-rise residential conversions, and buildings with complex fire strategies.

The S suffix (e.g. FD30S) denotes that the assembly is also tested to provide smoke control in addition to integrity, using an intumescent seal and cold smoke seal combination.

These ratings are achieved through destructive testing to BS EN 1634-1, which simulates a fully developed fire on one face of the door. Only the complete tested assembly — leaf, frame, hardware, intumescent seals, and glazing (where present) — achieves the rated performance. Substituting any component with an untested alternative invalidates the certification.

**Third-Party Certification**

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters installs fire door assemblies supplied by manufacturers holding third-party certification under the CERTIFIRE or BWF-CERTIFIRE scheme, which covers the door leaf, frame, and hardware as an integrated tested system. We also install door sets certificated under the LPCB (Loss Prevention Certification Board) scheme where this is specified by the client or their fire engineer.

Third-party certification provides the responsible person with independent assurance that the product has been manufactured to a consistent standard and that the certified performance is reproducible — unlike a single test certificate, which demonstrates only that one sample passed at one point in time.

**Installation Requirements**

Fire door installation is not equivalent to general joinery or door hanging. Every dimension matters: the gap between the door leaf and the frame must fall within the tolerances specified in the test evidence, as excessive gaps compromise the integrity of the intumescent seal. Hinge specification (number, dimensions, and position), latch bolt size, and overhead closer specification all form part of the tested assembly and cannot be substituted without invalidating the fire performance.

Our installers are trained to and assessed against the requirements of the BWF-CERTIFIRE Fire Door Installation Scheme (or equivalent), and we retain records of all installation training and certification. Every completed fire door installation receives a physical label on the hinge edge of the door leaf recording the installation date, the installer's name, and the fire rating, in accordance with the guidance issued by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) and FDIS (Fire Door Inspection Scheme).

**Gap Tolerances and Hardware**

The maximum permissible gap between the door leaf and the frame rebate on the hinge side, latch side, and head is 3 mm when measured with the door closed, in accordance with the guidance in BS 8214:2016 (Code of practice for fire door assemblies). At the threshold, the gap must not exceed 8 mm unless a specific threshold seal has been tested as part of the assembly.

Overhead door closers must be assessed and rated to BS EN 1154 (controlled door closing devices) and be of sufficient power to close and latch the door reliably from any position between 0° and 90°. For accessible routes, low-energy closers rated to BS EN 1154 can be combined with power-assisted openers to reduce the force required to open the door, while maintaining automatic closing function.

**Regulatory Context**

The Fire Safety (England) Regulations 2022 — introduced following the Grenfell Tower Inquiry — impose specific obligations on responsible persons in multi-occupied residential buildings with storeys over 11 m, including quarterly self-checks of all flat entrance fire doors and annual checks of all communal fire doors. Whilst these regulations apply specifically to residential buildings, the broader obligations under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 apply to all non-domestic premises, requiring that all fire doors are maintained in an effective condition and that records are kept.`,

FD30S additionally provides smoke control: the S suffix indicates the door has been tested to restrict the passage of cold smoke, using a cold smoke seal (usually a brush or compression seal) in addition to the intumescent seal that swells under heat. In most modern commercial buildings, the fire strategy requires FD30S or FD60S doors to corridors forming part of an escape route, as smoke is frequently more dangerous than flame in the early stages of a fire.',

    description: `A damaged shopfront is both a security risk and a commercial liability. Broken glazing exposes the interior of your premises to the elements and to opportunistic theft. A bent shutter that will not close fully negates your overnight security. A failed door closer or broken lock hardware compromises the integrity of your access control. In every case, the damage needs to be addressed quickly, competently, and with materials that match the original installation.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters operates a dedicated shopfront repair service across the UK, handling everything from a single broken glass panel to extensive impact damage requiring frame replacement and structural repairs. We carry a stock of commonly needed materials — glazing, frame sections, shutter laths, locking hardware — to enable same-day or next-day response to most repair requirements.

**Glazing Replacement**

Broken or damaged glazing is the most common repair requirement we attend to. Whether the cause is vandalism, vehicle impact, a burglary attempt, or accidental damage, the priority is to make the opening secure as quickly as possible and then to reinstate the correct glazing specification.

Our initial attendance includes installation of a temporary security board — a heavy-duty plywood or polycarbonate sheet fixed securely within the existing frame — if the replacement glass cannot be installed immediately. We measure the opening, establish the existing glass specification (thickness, make-up, any safety or security rating), and order the replacement unit from our glazing supply network. In most cases, standard toughened single-pane or sealed double-glazed unit replacements are available within 24–48 hours; bespoke specifications, large panels, or specialist glass types may require three to five working days.

All replacement glazing is installed in accordance with BS 6262 (glazing for buildings), and we document the glass specification on a works completion record for insurance and warranty purposes.

**Frame and Structural Repairs**

Vehicle impacts to shopfronts frequently cause damage beyond the glazing: aluminium frame sections can be bent, sheared, or twisted; fixing cramps can be pulled from the masonry; and the subframe or sill can be displaced. We assess the full extent of damage and determine whether the damaged section can be straightened and reinforced in situ, or whether the affected frame members need to be cut out and replaced.

Where a frame section is replaced, we match the existing profile and powder-coat finish as closely as possible. An exact match is achievable for current-production profile systems; for older or obsolete profiles, we work with profile suppliers to identify the closest available equivalent, and re-powder-coat the replacement section to match the existing colour.

**Roller Shutter Repairs**

Roller shutter damage typically falls into three categories: curtain damage (bent or buckled laths), guide rail damage (bent or displaced side channels), and mechanism failure (broken spring, failed motor, seized drive shaft). We assess which category applies and carry out the appropriate repair.

Curtain repairs on steel shutters involve removal and replacement of the damaged lath section. For aluminium curtains, lath replacement is similarly straightforward. Where lath replacements are not possible due to the shutter design or curtain age, we can supply and install a complete replacement curtain within the existing housing box and guides where these remain undamaged.

Spring failure is a common mechanical issue as shutters age: the coil spring that balances the curtain weight loses tension over years of use and eventually breaks. Spring replacement is a specialist task requiring safe decompression of the spring before removal, and must not be attempted by unqualified personnel. Our engineers carry the most common spring sizes to enable same-day replacement in most cases.

**Door Hardware Repairs**

Door closers, panic hardware, multi-point locking mechanisms, and hinges all have finite service lives, particularly on high-use commercial entrances. We repair and replace faulty hardware using components from established manufacturers — ASSA ABLOY, dormakaba, GEZE, and Dorma — and, for safety-critical components such as panic hardware and fire door closers, we use only tested replacements that comply with the relevant harmonised standard (BS EN 1125, BS EN 1154, etc.).

**Insurance Work**

The majority of shopfront damage we attend is the subject of an insurance claim. We are experienced in providing the documentation that insurers require: a photographic record of the damage taken before any temporary boarding, a detailed repair specification, a quantified estimate of repair costs, and — on completion — an invoice and works completion certificate.

We work directly with insurance loss adjusters and brokers, and our documentation is structured to provide the adjusters with a clear, itemised breakdown that facilitates straightforward claims settlement. Where the damage is such that a complete shopfront replacement is more cost-effective than repair, we make this clear in our assessment and provide comparative quotations for both options.`,

    description: `When a shopfront or security barrier fails outside of normal working hours — whether through vandalism, vehicle impact, attempted break-in, or mechanical failure — the consequences are immediate and serious. An open or unsecured premises is vulnerable to opportunistic theft, weather damage, and liability exposure. Every hour that passes without a secure boundary increases the risk and the potential loss.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters operates a 24/7 emergency callout service designed to get a qualified engineer to your premises as quickly as possible, make the site secure, and provide a clear assessment of the permanent repair or replacement required. We cover sites across the UK and maintain a network of regional engineers to minimise response times.

**What Constitutes a Shopfront Emergency?**

The most common emergency callout scenarios we attend are:

- **Smashed glazing** — whether from vandalism, attempted burglary, or accidental impact. Broken glass leaves the premises open and creates a significant public liability risk for passers-by.
- **Roller shutter stuck open or failed to close** — a shutter that will not close at the end of trading leaves stock, equipment, and the entire interior of the premises exposed overnight.
- **Vehicle impact damage** — a vehicle collision with a shopfront can displace the entire frame system, shatter multiple glazing panels, and in some cases affect the structural opening above.
- **Burglary damage** — after a forced-entry event, the entry point used by the perpetrators must be secured before the premises can be left unattended.
- **Failed door hardware** — a multi-point lock that jams shut (preventing staff from entering the premises in the morning) or a panic bar that fails to latch (preventing the premises from being secured at closing) both require urgent attendance.
- **Fire damage to a door or shutter** — after a fire, the affected compartment boundary must be reinstated as quickly as possible to restore the building's passive fire protection.

**Our Emergency Response Process**

When you call our emergency line, you will be connected immediately to an operative who will take the details of the incident, confirm the address, and dispatch the nearest available engineer. We will provide an estimated arrival time and keep you informed of the engineer's progress.

On arrival, the engineer's first priority is to make the premises secure. This typically involves boarding up any broken glazing with heavy-duty plywood or polycarbonate sheet, secured with screws into the existing frame or into rawl-plugged fixings in the masonry reveal. For roller shutter failures, we carry a range of common replacement springs, motor components, and manual override tools to address the most frequent causes of shutter failure on site.

Once the premises is secure, the engineer provides a written assessment of the damage and what is required for permanent reinstatement, together with a clear indication of timescale and cost. We take a photographic record of all damage before boarding begins, which forms part of the insurance documentation.

**Out-of-Hours Rates and Insurance**

Emergency callout attendance is priced on a transparent basis: a fixed callout charge covering the first hour of attendance plus travel time within our standard response zones, and an hourly rate thereafter for materials and labour. We provide a call-out attendance report that includes the time of call, time of attendance, work carried out, materials used, and the engineer's assessment of permanent repair requirements. This report is formatted to meet the documentation requirements of most commercial property insurers.

We work directly with loss adjusters and claims handlers for major commercial property insurers, and our emergency documentation is structured to facilitate rapid claims authorisation for emergency board-up and temporary security measures.

**Preventive Measures Following an Emergency**

Following an emergency attendance, we will discuss with you whether any changes to the shopfront specification could reduce the risk of a recurrence. Options commonly considered include:

- Upgrading to laminated or security-rated glazing (PAS 24:2022) to provide greater resistance to smash-and-grab attack
- Installing a roller shutter on a previously unprotected frontage
- Specifying a monitoring-grade security grille in addition to the existing shopfront
- Upgrading the locking hardware to a higher security rating

These upgrades can often be included within the permanent repair scope, and where they improve the security specification of the premises, insurers will sometimes contribute to the cost as part of the repair claim.`,

    description: `A roller shutter that will not open, close, or operate smoothly is more than an inconvenience — it is a security vulnerability. Every hour a shutter remains jammed, stuck halfway, or inoperable exposes your premises to risk: stock left unprotected, trading hours lost, and insurance cover potentially compromised if the insurer considers the shutter a condition of the policy. Fast, competent diagnosis and repair is essential.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters operates a dedicated roller shutter repair service across the UK, covering manual and electric shutters of all makes, ages, and configurations. Our engineers carry the most commonly needed spare parts — springs, motor components, replacement laths, locking hardware, and safety edge sensors — to enable same-day repair in the majority of cases.

**Common Shutter Failure Types**

Roller shutter failures fall into several distinct categories, and accurate diagnosis at the outset is critical to an efficient and cost-effective repair.

*Spring failure* is the most common mechanical fault we attend. The torsion spring (or springs, on wider shutters) balances the weight of the curtain, storing energy as the shutter closes and releasing it to assist opening. Over thousands of operating cycles, the spring loses tension and eventually fractures. A broken spring is immediately obvious: the shutter becomes extremely heavy to lift manually, or the electric motor struggles and stalls before reaching the fully open position. Spring failure is a wear item — it is not a defect, but an expected maintenance event that occurs sooner on high-cycle installations.

*Motor burnout* affects electric shutters and is typically caused by one of three factors: an overloaded motor (curtain weight exceeding the motor's rated capacity, often following a spring failure that went unaddressed), water ingress into the motor housing, or simple end-of-life failure after years of continuous service. Symptoms include the motor humming but not turning, tripping the circuit breaker, or producing no response at all when the key switch or remote is operated.

*Damaged laths* — the individual horizontal slats that make up the shutter curtain — result from vehicle impact, attempted forced entry, storm damage, or gradual corrosion in coastal environments. A single damaged lath can prevent the curtain from rolling smoothly into the housing box, causing the shutter to jam partway. If multiple laths are damaged, the curtain may not provide adequate security even when closed, as gaps and misalignment create points of weakness.

*Bent guide rails* are the vertical channels on either side of the opening through which the curtain travels. A vehicle impact or severe forced-entry attempt can bend or displace a guide rail, causing the curtain to bind, derail, or jam. In less severe cases, the curtain may still operate but with increased friction, noise, and accelerated wear on the lath edges.

*Jammed mechanisms* encompass a range of faults: seized drive shafts, failed limit switches (causing the motor to over-run and jam the curtain against the lintel or floor), corroded or seized locking bars, and foreign objects trapped in the guide rails. Our engineers systematically diagnose the root cause before commencing repair, avoiding the common mistake of treating symptoms rather than the underlying fault.

**Diagnostic Process**

Every shutter repair begins with a structured assessment. Our engineer inspects the curtain, guide rails, housing box, spring assembly, motor (where fitted), control equipment, and locking hardware. We operate the shutter through a partial cycle (where safe to do so) to identify the point of failure, and we inspect the electrical supply and control circuit on motorised installations. This assessment typically takes 15–30 minutes and results in a clear diagnosis, a recommended scope of repair, and a cost indication before any work commences.

**Spring Replacement**

Spring replacement is a specialist task that must not be attempted by unqualified personnel. Torsion springs store significant energy when wound, and an uncontrolled release during removal can cause serious injury. Our engineers use purpose-designed winding bars and follow the safe working procedures specified by the DHF (Door and Hardware Federation) for spring de-tensioning and replacement.

We carry the most common spring sizes and wire gauges to enable same-day replacement. For non-standard or heavy-duty springs, we can typically source and fit a replacement within 24–48 hours. All replacement springs are specified to match the curtain weight and operating cycle requirement, ensuring the correct balance is restored and the expected service life is achieved.

**Motor Repair vs Replacement**

When a motor fails, the decision between repair and replacement depends on the nature of the fault, the age of the motor, and the cost differential. Minor faults — a failed capacitor, a worn brush set (on DC motors), or a faulty limit switch — can often be repaired on site at a fraction of the replacement cost. Where the motor winding has burned out, or where the gearbox has suffered internal damage, replacement is almost always more cost-effective and reliable than attempting a rewind or rebuild.

We supply replacement motors from established manufacturers including Somfy, Simu, and Cherubini, and we match the replacement unit to the curtain weight, barrel diameter, and operating speed of the existing installation. All replacement motors are supplied with a manufacturer's warranty.

**Curtain Lath Replacement**

Individual damaged laths can be removed and replaced without dismantling the entire curtain assembly. The damaged section is cut out, the replacement lath is threaded into position, and the end locks or wind locks are refitted to secure the new lath within the curtain. For steel curtains, we carry the most common lath profiles in galvanised finish; for aluminium curtains, we source the matching profile from the original fabricator where possible.

Where the curtain damage is extensive — multiple laths buckled, the curtain perforated, or corrosion has weakened a significant section — we may recommend a complete curtain replacement within the existing housing box and guide rails, which is typically more cost-effective than replacing individual laths across a large area.

**Guide Rail Straightening and Replacement**

Bent guide rails can sometimes be straightened in situ using hydraulic or mechanical straightening tools, provided the distortion is within correctable limits and the rail material has not been fatigued beyond its service tolerance. Where a guide rail is severely damaged, kinked, or has pulled away from its fixings, replacement is necessary.

Replacement guide rails are cut to length on site and fixed to the masonry or steel reveal using the appropriate anchor fixings. We ensure the new rail is plumb, parallel, and correctly spaced to provide smooth curtain travel with the correct clearance specified by the shutter manufacturer.

**Emergency Shutter Repair**

A shutter stuck in the open position overnight represents an immediate security emergency. We provide emergency shutter repair attendance through our 24/7 callout service, with the aim of either completing the repair on site or, where the repair requires parts that are not immediately available, manually closing and securing the shutter in the down position until the permanent repair can be completed.

**Preventive Maintenance**

Many shutter failures are preventable with regular maintenance. The DHF recommends that all power-operated shutters are inspected and serviced at least annually by a competent person, with high-cycle installations serviced every six months. A preventive maintenance visit includes lubrication of all moving parts, tension testing of springs, safety edge and photocell testing on motorised shutters, inspection of the curtain and guide rails for wear or damage, and verification of the manual override mechanism. We offer annual and six-monthly maintenance contracts that reduce the risk of unexpected failure and extend the working life of the installation.`,

    description: `Broken, cracked, or failed glazing in a commercial shopfront is one of the most urgent repair requirements a business can face. A shattered pane leaves the premises physically open to the elements and to opportunistic theft. A misted or failed double-glazed unit, while less immediately critical, degrades the appearance of the frontage and compromises the thermal performance of the building envelope. In both cases, prompt replacement with correctly specified glass is essential.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters provides a comprehensive commercial glass replacement service across the UK, covering single-pane toughened glass, laminated security glass, sealed double-glazed units (DGUs), and specialist glazing including solar-control, acoustic, and security-rated products. We handle everything from a single broken panel in a shopfront to the complete re-glazing of a multi-unit retail parade.

**Types of Commercial Glass**

Understanding the different types of glass used in commercial shopfronts is important for specifying the correct replacement.

*Toughened safety glass* (also called tempered glass) is the standard glazing material for commercial shopfronts. Manufactured by heating float glass to approximately 620°C and then rapidly cooling it, toughened glass is four to five times stronger than annealed glass of the same thickness. When it does break, it fractures into small, relatively blunt granules rather than the large, sharp shards produced by annealed glass, significantly reducing the risk of laceration injury. Toughened glass is manufactured to BS EN 12150-1 and is permanently marked with the kite mark, the standard number, and the manufacturer's identification.

*Laminated glass* consists of two or more layers of glass bonded together with a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) or ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) interlayer. When broken, the fragments adhere to the interlayer rather than falling free, maintaining a degree of barrier integrity even after fracture. Laminated glass is manufactured to BS EN ISO 12543 and is specified where post-breakage performance is important — for example, overhead glazing, balustrades, and security applications where resistance to repeated impact or forced entry is required.

*Double-glazed units (DGUs)* — also called insulated glass units (IGUs) — consist of two panes of glass separated by a hermetically sealed cavity, typically filled with argon or krypton gas to improve thermal insulation. The cavity is maintained by a spacer bar around the perimeter, bonded to both panes with a primary butyl seal and a secondary structural sealant. DGUs are specified where thermal performance is a requirement — which, under Building Regulations Part L for non-domestic buildings, applies to virtually all new or replacement glazing in commercial premises. Centre-pane U-values for standard argon-filled DGUs typically fall between 1.0 and 1.4 W/m²K depending on the glass combination and coating specification.

*Security-rated glass* is laminated glass that has been independently tested and certified to resist attack. The principal standard for enhanced security glazing in the UK is PAS 24:2022, which tests the complete window or door assembly (not just the glass) against manual attack with common hand tools. For glazing-only performance, the relevant classification is BS EN 356, which grades glass from P1A (resistance to ball drop impact) through P8B (resistance to prolonged manual attack with an axe). Many commercial insurers now specify a minimum security glazing grade for ground-floor retail premises, and PAS 24 certification is increasingly required by landlords and local authority licensing conditions.

**When Glass Replacement Is Needed**

The most common reasons for commercial glass replacement are:

*Vandalism and impact damage* — a thrown object, a vehicle impact, or an attempted break-in can shatter or crack a shopfront pane. In the case of toughened glass, the entire pane will disintegrate; laminated glass may crack but typically remains in the frame. In both cases, replacement is required.

*Failed sealed units (misting DGUs)* — over time, the perimeter seal of a double-glazed unit can degrade, allowing moisture to enter the cavity. This produces a persistent misting or condensation between the panes that cannot be cleaned. A failed DGU no longer provides its designed thermal insulation performance, and its appearance is unacceptable for a retail frontage. The failed unit must be replaced; it cannot be economically repaired.

*Accidental damage* — a forklift manoeuvre, a delivery vehicle reversing into a glazed panel, or an internal impact from equipment or stock. We document accidental damage for insurance purposes in the same manner as vandalism damage.

*Regulatory upgrade* — in some cases, glass replacement is prompted not by damage but by a change in regulatory requirements or a landlord's specification. For example, upgrading from single-pane toughened glass to a DGU to meet Part L thermal requirements following a change of use, or upgrading to PAS 24 security glazing as a condition of a new insurance policy or licence.

**Measurement and Specification Process**

Accurate measurement and correct specification are critical to a successful glass replacement. Our process begins with a site visit where we measure the glazing aperture, record the frame rebate depth and bead detail, and identify the existing glass specification from the markings on the broken or failed unit. Where the existing specification cannot be determined from the remnants (for example, where the glass has been completely removed for safety), we consult the original shopfront installer's records or specify a replacement that meets the current regulatory requirements.

For DGU replacements, we record the overall unit thickness, the individual pane thicknesses, the spacer bar width and type, the gas fill requirement, and any low-emissivity or solar-control coating specification. We then order the replacement unit from our glazing supply network, which maintains stock of the most common standard sizes and can manufacture bespoke units to order within three to five working days.

**Compliance and Standards**

All replacement glazing is installed in accordance with BS 6262 (Glazing for buildings), which provides the code of practice for the design, installation, and maintenance of glazing in buildings. BS 6262 addresses glass selection based on location within the building, wind loading, human impact safety, and environmental factors.

For safety glazing — glass installed in critical locations where there is a risk of human impact — the relevant standard is BS EN 12600, which classifies glass by its breakage pattern and resistance to body impact. Critical locations are defined in BS 6262-4 and include glazing below 800 mm from floor level, glazing in or adjacent to doors, and glazing in areas where people might fall against the glass.

Toughened safety glass is manufactured to BS EN 12150, and laminated safety glass to BS EN ISO 12543. Both standards require permanent marking of the glass, and we verify the presence and correctness of these markings on all replacement units before installation.

For thermal performance, replacement DGUs must demonstrate compliance with Building Regulations Part L. We specify units with an appropriate combination of low-emissivity coatings and gas fill to achieve the required centre-pane U-value, and we provide documentary evidence of the U-value achieved for building control inspection where required.

**Emergency Boarding Before Replacement**

Where a glazing panel has been broken and the replacement glass is not immediately available, our first priority is to make the opening secure. We install temporary boarding — heavy-duty plywood or polycarbonate sheet secured within the existing frame — to protect the premises from weather ingress and unauthorised entry. The boarding is installed with discrete fixings that do not damage the frame, allowing clean removal when the replacement glass arrives.

For retail premises where maintaining visibility and trading appearance is important, we can install clear polycarbonate temporary glazing rather than opaque boarding, subject to the security risk assessment for the premises.

**Turnaround Times**

Standard toughened single-pane replacements in common thicknesses (6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm) are typically available within 24–48 hours from our glazing supply network. Standard argon-filled DGU replacements are available within three to five working days. Specialist glass — security-rated laminated glass, solar-control glass, acoustic glass, or non-standard sizes — may require five to ten working days depending on the specification and manufacturer availability.

For emergency glazing requirements, we can often source standard toughened glass on a same-day or next-day basis, with installation scheduled immediately upon delivery.

**Colour-Matched Frames**

Where glass replacement requires the removal and refitting of glazing beads, cappings, or frame trim, we take care to match the existing frame colour and finish. For current-production aluminium profile systems, replacement beads and trims are available in the original colour from the system supplier. For older or discontinued profiles, we source the closest available match and, where necessary, arrange powder-coating to the original RAL or BS 4800 colour reference to ensure a seamless appearance after repair.`,

    description: `Aluminium doors are the standard entrance solution for commercial buildings across the UK, from high-street retail units and office reception areas to warehouses, schools, and healthcare facilities. When correctly specified, an aluminium entrance door delivers the combination of structural strength, slim sightlines, weather resistance, and design versatility that commercial environments demand — at a price point that makes economic sense over a 25-year service life.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters supplies and installs commercial aluminium doors as standalone entrance systems and as integrated elements within larger shopfront, curtain walling, and glazed screen installations. We work with hinged, pivot, and double-leaf configurations, using profile systems from leading European fabricators that are independently tested and CE-marked to BS EN 14351-1.

**Door Configurations**

Single-leaf hinged doors are the most common commercial entrance configuration, suitable for offices, individual retail units, and service entrances. Standard commercial door leaf sizes range from 900 mm to 1200 mm in width, with heights up to 2400 mm. For wider openings or premises with high footfall requiring simultaneous two-way traffic, double-leaf (French door) configurations provide a clear opening of 1600 mm to 2400 mm.

Pivot doors — where the leaf rotates on a top-and-bottom pivot rather than side-hung hinges — are specified for large, heavy door leaves (typically over 100 kg) or for architectural effect. Pivot doors require a floor socket and overhead pivot bearing, and the door leaf must be precisely balanced to ensure smooth, effortless operation.

**Thermal Performance**

For commercial buildings subject to Building Regulations Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Power), thermally broken aluminium door frames are required. Our thermally broken profiles incorporate a continuous polyamide insulating strip within the aluminium section, reducing heat transfer through the frame and eliminating the cold-bridging and internal condensation that non-broken frames produce.

Complete door assembly U-values for our thermally broken systems typically range from 1.2 to 1.8 W/m²K depending on the glazing specification, comfortably meeting the elemental U-value targets set out in Approved Document L2 for non-domestic buildings.

**Security Specification**

Commercial entrance doors are frequently a target for forced entry. We offer door sets tested and certified to PAS 24:2022 (Enhanced Security Performance Requirements for Doorsets and Windows), the standard most commonly referenced by commercial insurers. PAS 24 door sets are tested as a complete assembly — frame, leaf, glazing, and hardware together — against a defined series of manual and mechanical attack tests.

Multi-point locking is standard on our commercial aluminium doors, engaging the frame at a minimum of three points. Anti-drill, anti-pick, and anti-bump euro profile cylinders rated to TS 007 three-star are specified as standard, and we can accommodate master-keying and restricted keyway requirements for multi-tenanted buildings.

**Glazing Options**

Aluminium door leaves can be fully glazed, partially glazed with a solid lower panel, or solid with a vision panel. Glazing is typically toughened safety glass to BS EN 12150-1 as a minimum, with laminated or security-rated glass specified for PAS 24 assemblies. For energy performance, double-glazed units with low-emissivity coatings are standard.

**DDA Compliance**

The Equality Act 2010 requires that commercial premises provide accessible entrances. Our aluminium doors are designed with low thresholds (maximum 15 mm upstand), minimum 775 mm clear opening width as standard (extendable to 900 mm or beyond), and lever handle furniture at accessible heights in accordance with BS 8300. Where automatic operation is required, our doors can be fitted with swing-door operators to provide powered opening — see our automatic doors service for details.

**Powder Coating and Finish**

All aluminium door sections are powder-coated to BS EN 12206-1 in any RAL Classic or RAL Design colour. Our standard guarantee covers colour retention and adhesion for 10 years under normal UK exposure conditions. Dual-colour finishes — a different colour on the internal and external faces — are available for premises where the interior colour scheme differs from the external branding.`,

    metaDescription:
      'Commercial aluminium window installation across the UK. Thermally broken frames, toughened glazing, BS 6375 weather rated. Fixed, casement & tilt-and-turn options.',
    description: `Commercial aluminium windows are a core element of modern retail, office, and industrial building envelopes. Whether installed as part of a shopfront system, within a curtain wall assembly, or as standalone window units in a commercial facade, aluminium windows deliver the combination of structural rigidity, slim profiles, large glazed areas, and long-term durability that commercial specifications demand.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters designs and installs commercial aluminium window systems across the UK, working with fixed-light, top-hung (awning), side-hung (casement), and tilt-and-turn configurations from leading profile fabricators. All our window systems are CE-marked to BS EN 14351-1 and independently tested for air permeability, watertightness, and wind resistance to BS 6375.

**Window Types for Commercial Applications**

*Fixed-light windows* are the most common configuration in shopfront and curtain wall installations. The glass is permanently fixed within the aluminium frame with no opening mechanism, maximising the glazed area and providing the best thermal and acoustic performance. Fixed lights are used for display windows, high-level glazing, and any location where ventilation is provided by other means.

*Top-hung (awning) windows* open outward from the bottom, hinged at the top. This configuration is popular for commercial buildings because it allows ventilation while providing some rain protection when partially open. Top-hung windows are frequently specified above shopfront transoms to provide natural ventilation to the trading floor.

*Side-hung (casement) windows* open outward on side hinges. They provide the maximum opening area for ventilation and are commonly used in office buildings, schools, and healthcare facilities where building regulations require a minimum opening area for purge ventilation.

*Tilt-and-turn windows* offer dual-mode operation: tilting inward from the top for secure ventilation, or swinging inward on side hinges for full opening. This configuration is particularly suitable for upper-floor commercial premises where outward-opening windows present a risk or are restricted by planning conditions.

**Thermal Performance**

All our commercial aluminium windows use thermally broken profiles as standard. The polyamide thermal break within the aluminium section reduces the frame U-value to between 1.5 and 2.5 W/m²K depending on the profile depth. Combined with double-glazed units featuring low-emissivity coatings and argon gas fill, our complete window assemblies achieve overall U-values of 1.2 to 1.6 W/m²K, meeting the requirements of Building Regulations Part L for replacement and new-build commercial glazing.

For projects with demanding energy performance targets — BREEAM-rated buildings, Passivhaus-influenced specifications, or buildings subject to enhanced planning conditions — we can specify triple-glazed units and enhanced thermal break profiles to achieve overall U-values below 1.0 W/m²K.

**Weather Performance**

Commercial windows face the full range of UK weather conditions, including driving rain, sustained wind loads, and rapid temperature changes. Our window systems are tested to BS 6375 for air permeability (Class 4 as standard), watertightness (typically Class 7A or 9A depending on exposure), and wind resistance (Class C5 for most commercial applications).

For buildings in exposed coastal or elevated locations, we specify enhanced weather seals and drainage provisions to ensure the window assembly performs reliably under the higher wind-driven rain loads encountered in these environments.

**Glazing Specification**

All glazing installed in our commercial aluminium windows uses toughened safety glass to BS EN 12150-1 as a minimum. For windows in critical locations — below 800 mm from floor level, as defined in BS 6262 — the glass must meet the impact classification requirements of BS EN 12600.

Double-glazed sealed units are standard for commercial installations, providing thermal insulation, acoustic attenuation, and condensation resistance. We specify low-emissivity coated glass as standard and can accommodate solar-control, acoustic, and privacy glass options to meet specific project requirements.

**Security**

Opening windows in commercial premises are potential entry points for intruders. We offer window assemblies tested to PAS 24:2022 for enhanced security, incorporating multi-point espagnolette locking, shoot-bolt engagement at top and bottom, and security glazing. Lockable restrictors can be specified to limit the opening angle while allowing controlled ventilation — a common requirement for upper-floor offices and healthcare buildings.

**Powder Coat Finish**

All aluminium window sections are powder-coated to BS EN 12206-1 in any RAL Classic or RAL Design colour. Marine-grade powder coat specifications are available for coastal installations where salt exposure demands enhanced corrosion protection.`,

      'Aluminium curtain walling design and installation for commercial buildings. Stick-built & unitised systems, structural glazing, BS EN 13830 tested. UK-wide service.',
    description: `Curtain walling is a non-load-bearing facade system that spans between floor slabs or structural frames, creating a continuous glazed or panelled envelope around a commercial building. Unlike a traditional shopfront — which is installed within a single-storey structural opening — a curtain wall can extend across multiple storeys and is designed to resist wind loads, support its own dead weight, accommodate thermal and structural movement, and provide weather exclusion, thermal insulation, and acoustic attenuation for the entire building envelope.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters designs and installs aluminium curtain wall systems for a range of commercial applications: multi-storey office buildings, retail developments, mixed-use schemes, hotels, educational buildings, and healthcare facilities. We work with stick-built and unitised curtain wall systems, using profiles from established fabricators whose products are tested and certified to BS EN 13830 — the European standard for curtain walling.

**Stick-Built vs Unitised Systems**

*Stick-built curtain walling* is assembled on site from individual aluminium mullions (vertical members) and transoms (horizontal members), with glass or panel infills glazed into the grid after the framework is erected. Stick-built systems are versatile, cost-effective for smaller projects, and allow adjustments during installation to accommodate site tolerances. They are the most common curtain wall type for single and two-storey commercial facades.

*Unitised curtain walling* consists of factory-assembled panels — each containing a section of mullion, transom, glazing, and weather seals — that are craned into position and clipped together on site. Unitised systems offer faster on-site installation, higher factory quality control, and better weather sealing, but require greater upfront design investment and are typically specified for larger multi-storey projects where the speed and consistency benefits justify the premium.

**Structural Performance**

Curtain wall mullions and transoms are structural members that resist wind loads — both positive pressure and negative suction — and transfer these loads to the primary building structure at each floor level or structural bracket point. The mullion section is sized by structural calculation to resist the design wind pressure for the building height, location, and exposure category, calculated in accordance with BS EN 1991-1-4 (Eurocode 1: Wind actions).

Our structural calculations are prepared by a qualified engineer and submitted to the building control body as part of the Building Regulations application. Deflection limits for curtain wall mullions are typically L/200 under design wind load (where L is the span between fixings), although more stringent limits may apply for specific glazing types or for buildings with enhanced serviceability requirements.

**Thermal Performance**

Curtain wall systems must comply with Building Regulations Part L for non-domestic buildings, achieving overall facade U-values that contribute to the building's target energy performance. Our curtain wall profiles incorporate polyamide thermal breaks within the aluminium mullions and transoms, reducing the frame-zone U-value to between 1.5 and 2.5 W/m²K depending on the profile depth and thermal break width.

Combined with high-performance double-glazed units (typically 1.0 to 1.1 W/m²K centre-pane) and insulated spandrel panels, the overall curtain wall assembly achieves the facade U-values required for compliance with Part L and, where specified, BREEAM or other sustainability assessment targets.

**Weather Performance and Testing**

Curtain wall systems are tested to BS EN 13830 for air permeability, watertightness, and wind resistance. This standard is specific to curtain walling and differs from BS 6375 (which applies to windows and doors). The test sequence includes static air permeability, watertightness under static and dynamic pressure, and wind resistance under positive and negative pressure.

Our systems are also tested for resistance to water penetration under pulsating air pressure — the "hose test" — which simulates the driving rain conditions encountered on exposed UK building facades. Weather sealing is achieved through a combination of EPDM gaskets, silicone weather seals, and pressure-equalised drainage chambers within the mullion and transom profiles.

**Glazing and Infill Options**

Curtain wall infill panels can be glazed or opaque. Glazed infills use double-glazed sealed units with performance specifications selected to meet the project's thermal, solar, acoustic, and safety requirements. Spandrel panels — the opaque sections typically located at floor-slab and beam levels — use insulated aluminium composite, enamelled glass, or stone cladding backed by thermal insulation.

Structural glazing — where the glass is bonded to the aluminium frame with structural silicone rather than retained by external pressure plates — creates a flush external appearance with no visible frame on the outside face. Structural glazing requires specific design calculations, silicone compatibility testing, and quality-controlled application, all of which we manage as part of the project.

**Fire Compartmentation**

Where a curtain wall passes across a fire compartment boundary — typically at each floor slab — fire stopping is required to prevent fire and smoke from spreading through the void between the curtain wall and the floor slab edge. We install tested fire-stop systems using mineral wool and intumescent sealant, certified to achieve the required fire resistance period (typically 60 or 120 minutes) at each compartment junction.`,

    description: `Glass shopfronts — also known as frameless shopfronts or structural glass facades — use minimal or no visible aluminium framing to create the most transparent possible retail entrance. Where a traditional aluminium shopfront uses mullions and transoms to support the glazing, a glass shopfront relies on the structural capacity of the toughened glass itself, supported by patch fittings, point fixings, or slender stainless-steel hardware that is visually unobtrusive.

The result is a shopfront with maximum transparency: an uninterrupted view of the retail interior from the street, maximum natural light penetration, and a contemporary, high-end aesthetic that communicates quality and openness to prospective customers.

Grewal Shopfront & Shutters designs and installs glass shopfront systems for retail units, showrooms, restaurants, galleries, and any commercial premises where visual transparency is a primary design objective.

**Frameless Glass Construction**

In a frameless glass shopfront, each glass panel is a structural element. The glass is toughened to BS EN 12150-1 — typically 10 mm or 12 mm thick for shopfront applications — and is self-supporting within the limits of the panel size and wind load. Panels are joined at their edges by patch fittings (stainless-steel clamps fixed through holes drilled in the glass), by structural silicone bonding, or by channel fixings at head and sill that allow the glass to stand vertically without intermediate mullions.

The absence of aluminium mullions means that each glass panel must be sized to resist the full wind load on its area without deflecting beyond acceptable limits. Maximum panel sizes are determined by the glass thickness, aspect ratio, and the design wind pressure for the site. Typical maximum panel sizes for 12 mm toughened glass in a shopfront application are approximately 3.0 m in height by 2.0 m in width, although this varies with wind loading and support conditions.

**Glass Door Options**

Glass shopfront entrance doors can be frameless (using patch fittings and a floor spring or overhead pivot) or framed within a minimal stainless-steel or slim aluminium frame. Frameless glass doors use 10 mm or 12 mm toughened glass with top and bottom patch fittings, a floor-spring closer recessed into the threshold, and pull handles bolted through the glass.

For premises requiring automatic operation, we integrate automatic sliding or swing door operators within the glass shopfront design. Sliding systems use a slim overhead track with minimal visible hardware; swing systems use a concealed floor-spring or overhead operator. See our automatic doors service for full details.

**Structural Glazing and Point Fixings**

For larger glass facades or multi-storey applications, point-fixed structural glazing uses stainless-steel spider fittings or button fixings to connect the glass panels to a supporting structure — typically stainless-steel rods, cable trusses, or structural glass fins. This approach allows floor-to-ceiling glazing with no visible framing, creating the most transparent possible facade.

Point-fixed glazing requires specialist engineering: each fixing must be designed to transfer wind loads and dead loads through the glass without inducing unacceptable stress concentrations around the fixing holes. Our systems use countersunk stainless-steel fixings with nylon bushes that distribute the load across the glass thickness, and all fixing positions are verified by finite-element stress analysis.

**Safety and Compliance**

All glass in shopfront applications must comply with BS 6262 for glazing in buildings and must use safety glass — toughened to BS EN 12150-1 or laminated to BS EN ISO 12543 — in all critical locations as defined by the standard. For frameless glass doors, the glass must also comply with BS EN 12600 for impact classification.

Where the glass shopfront incorporates a DDA-compliant entrance, manifestation markings are applied to the glass at two height bands (850–1000 mm and 1400–1600 mm above floor level) to make the glazing visible to partially sighted people, as required by BS 8300 and Approved Document M.

**Thermal Considerations**

Single-pane frameless glass shopfronts do not achieve the U-values required by Building Regulations Part L for new-build or major refurbishment. Where Part L compliance is required, we can specify frameless double-glazed units using structural silicone edge bonding, or specify a hybrid system with minimal aluminium framing at head and sill to support a double-glazed sealed unit. The appropriate solution depends on the building control body's interpretation of Part L requirements for the specific project.

For existing shopfront replacements that do not trigger Part L requirements, single-pane toughened glass frameless systems remain a popular and visually striking option.`,
